# ArduinoSimon
A fully featured Arduino version of the classic memory game Simon. Each generated sequence is fully animated by the Arduino using a series of colored LEDs and a passive buzzer to play tones.

## Materials
Materials needed to construct this project are as follows:
* 4X LEDs (Red, green, blue, and yellow)
* 4X 330 Ohm resistors
* 4X Tactile buttons
* 4X 10k Ohm resistors (for pull up button configuration)
* 1X Passive buzzer
* 1X Arduino Uno or equivalent
* 1X Full sized breadboard
* A series of male to male breadboard jumper wires
